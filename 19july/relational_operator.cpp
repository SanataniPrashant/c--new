// ### Relational operators : These operators are used to establish a relationship between two operands.These are binary operators.
// Relational operators are used to compare two operands and returns a boolean value.
// ->>> Types of relational operators: (6)
// 1. < less than
// 2. > greater than
// 3.== eqal to
// 4.!= not equal to
// 5.<= less than eqal to
// 6.>= greater than equal to
// Relational operators are used to create a boolean expressions.
// Boolean expressions results in binary values that are true or false; 0 is considered as false and 1 is considered as true.
// Non-Zero values are considerd as true in c++.

// ### Logical operators: they are used to establish relationship between two or more relational expressions or two boolean values.
// They are also type of binary operators.
// ->>> Types of logical operators: (3)
// 1. &&  and operator
// 2. || or operator
// 3. ! not operator: It is used to reverse the result of boolean expression.
// Ex.  
// a=10
// b=3
// c=7
// a>b && b<c;
